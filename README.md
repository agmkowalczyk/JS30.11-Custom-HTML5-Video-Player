# Custom HTML5 Video Player

## Description
This project shows how to build totally custom video interface when the default controls are hidden. 
There is a button to pause and play it, a button to volume, an option to speed it right up then it goes much faster, 
buttons that allow to skip forward 25 seconds, skip back 10 seconds, and when the user clicks the video itself, it will pause and play.
